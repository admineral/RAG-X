# RAG-X: Advanced Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework ðŸš§

RAG-X is a cutting-edge AI framework designed to revolutionize video content analysis, retrieval, and understanding by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with knowledge graph capabilities. This framework deconstructs complex video data into structured, meaningful components and maps them in an interconnected graph, enhancing semantic search, contextual analysis, and information retrieval.

> ðŸš§ **Note**: RAG-X is currently under active development. We are continuously building and refining its features, so stay tuned for updates! Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome!

## Planned Workflow

The diagram below outlines the planned workflow for the RAG-X framework:

## Key Components

1. **Video Upload and Extraction**
   - The first step involves uploading the video and extracting its key components, such as frames and audio transcripts, for further analysis.

2. **Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Breaks down long videos into manageable segments for focused content analysis. This includes frame extraction, similarity search, semantic/context analysis, and scene clustering.

3. **Captioning Pipeline**
   - Generates high-precision captions and metadata for video clips using advanced AI models like Qwen2-VL, BLIP2, SAM2, and more.

4. **Knowledge Base Structuring**
   - Constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph to represent relationships between scenes, segments, and entities, allowing for advanced querying, semantic search, and contextual analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Video Understanding**: Leveraging more advanced models for better scene understanding and narrative creation.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimizing the pipeline for faster, real-time video processing and retrieval.
- **User Interface**: Developing an intuitive UI for easy navigation and interaction with the knowledge graph.
